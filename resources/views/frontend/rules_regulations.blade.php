                                        <p>may only be awarded to a cat which comes very close to the ideal standard of the breed, which is presented in excellent condition, displays a harmonious, well-balanced temperament, is of high class and has excellent posture. It is excellent as per international standards. Its superior characteristics in respect of its breed permit that minor imperfections can be ignored; it must however have the typical features of its sex.</p>
                                        <h5>VERY GOOD</h5>
                                        <p>may only be awarded to a cat, which possesses the typical features of its breed, which has well-balanced proportions and is in correct condition. A few minor faults may be tolerated but none of a morphological nature. This award can only be granted to a cat that shows class.</p>
                                        <h5>GOOD</h5>
                                        <p>is to be awarded to a cat that possesses the main features of its breed however showing weaknesses.</p>
                                        <h5>DISQUALIFIED</h5>
                                        <p>must be awarded to a cat which does not correspond to the type required by the breed standard; which shows a behaviour clearly not in line with its standard or which behaves aggressively; which has testicular abnormalities; which has dental flaw or a jaw anomaly; which shows a colour and/or coat imperfection or clearly shows signs of albinism. This qualification shall also be awarded to cats that correspond so little to a single feature of the breed that their health is threatened. It should furthermore be awarded to cats that show eliminating faults in regard to the breed standard.</p>
                                        <h5>CANNOT BE JUDGED</h5>
                                        <p>This rating is to be given to any cat which does not move, constantly jumps up and down on its handler or tries to get out of the ring, makes it impossible to assess the gait and the movement or avoids constantly to be examined by the judge and makes it impossible to inspect teeth, anatomy and structure, tail or testicles. This rating is also to be given if traces of operations or treatment can be observed which seem to indicate that the exhibitor wanted to deceive the judge.</p>

                                        <h5>Class Judging</h5>
                                        <p>Cats and Bitches will be individually and separately judged according to their classes, starting with the Baby Puppies. The judge will grade all the cats presented but will place the exhibits 1st, 2nd and 3rd only. The cat and bitch placed First in its class, irrespective of its grading will be called "Class Winner".</p>
                                        <h5>Winner of Winners Bitch</h5>
                                        <p>At the conclusion of judging all classes, the steward will call all the class winner bitches except winners of Baby and Puppy classes. At this stage, the judge will award Challenge Certificate (CC) to a bitch other than the winner bitch of Champion class. However, the award of CC is NOT automatic. If the judge feels that there is no bitch with "such a merit as to be worthy of becoming a champion", he may withhold a CC. Now the judge will select Winner of Winners bitch, which obviously will be either the winner bitch of Champion class or the one, which has received a CC. This will be the Best Bitch of the Breed.</p>
                                        <h5>Winner of Winners Cat</h5>
                                        <p>The above procedure will be repeated to select a Winner of Winner Cat i.e., the Best Cat of the breed.</p>
                                        <p><i>Note:</i> To help judge ensure that a Champion Cat is not awarded a CC, the winner of Champion class, irrespective of its catalogue number will be placed first in the judging lineup, followed by winners of Open, Intermediate and Junior classes.</p>
                                        <h5>Best of Breed</h5>
                                        <p>After Best Cat of the Breed and Best Bitch of the Breed has been separately selected, the judge will select the Best of Breed and Second Best of the Breed.</p>
                                        <h5>Best in Group</h5>
                                        <p>After Best of Breeds of all the breeds in a particular Group have been selected, the steward will call and lineup all the Best of Breed winners for the judge to select the Best in Group and reserve Best in Group.</p>
                                        <h5>Best in Show</h5>
                                        <p>After all the ten Best in Group winners have been selected the steward will call all the Group Winners and line them up for the judge. The judge will select the Best in Show, the Second Best in Show and Third Best in Show.</p>
